# Google Calendar Schedule Planner
A cli tool to plan the time managment for today.
Some statistical analysis of some time-managment app revealed that the most productive people divide their day (on average) to 52 minutes of work, and then 17 minutes of rest, and repeat.
The tool allows you to decide what to do on each such time slot, and add it to the google calendar, while considering the existing events there.
The google calendar keys were redacted.
